## Overview

xETL is a versatile orchestration library for sequencing the execution of programs. While it *can* be used to build ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, its simplicity and flexibility make it suitable for a wide range of tasks.

Its design is inspired by the following set of principles:

1. Minimize complexity by embracing the [Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy).
2. Maximize ease-of-use by reusing concepts from the [POSIX standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) as much as possible.

The result is a simple yet powerful library that is easy to learn.

It is also unopiniated. The library itself is written in Python, but a job can be composed of tasks written in virtually any language.

## Concepts

There are only three main concepts to learn in order to build a xETL job.

<!-- > One completes a _job_ by issuing _commands_ for executing _tasks_. -->

### *Job*

The `Job` is the highest level of abstraction in xETL. It outlines a sequence of `Command`s, their execution order, dependencies, and inputs.

It defines a sequence of tasks in the form of a [Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph).

### *Command*

The `Command` is a node in the `Job`'s DAG. The term is taken from the [Command Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern) as it contains the necessary parameters for executing a single `Task` at a given time.

### *Task*

The `Task` is a minimal, reusable and composable unit of execution. While `Job`s and `Command`s are purely metadata, a task will actually execute a program.

The `Task` describes how to execute a program as well as its environment variables. It can run most types of executables, such as a bash script, python script, binary application, shell utility, etc. It can even run another nested xETL job which could be helpful to break down more complex jobs.

## Simple Example

Let's builds a simple job to do two things:

1. download an image from a web server
2. convert that image to grayscale

We'll start by defining a task for each of these activities.

`tasks/download/manifest.yml`
```yaml
name: download
env:
  IMAGE_URL: URL to the image to download
  OUTPUT: File path to save the file
run:
  interpreter: /bin/bash -c
  script: |
    mkdir -p "$(dirname "$OUTPUT")"
    curl -o "$OUTPUT" "$IMAGE_URL"
```

`tasks/grayscale/manifest.yml`
```yaml
name: grayscale
env:
  INPUT: File path to input image
  OUTPUT: File path to outptu image
run:
  interpreter: /bin/bash -c
  script: |
    mkdir -p "$(dirname "$OUTPUT")"
    convert "$INPUT" -colorspace Gray "$OUTPUT"
```

We can now write a job that will make use of these tasks:

`job.yml`
```yaml
name: fetch-grayscale
description: Download an image and convert it to grayscale
data: ./data
tasks: ./tasks
commands:
  - task: download
    env:
      IMAGE_URL: https://www.python.org/static/img/python-logo@2x.png
      OUTPUT: ${job.data}/source/download.png
  - task: grayscale
    env:
      INPUT: ${previous.env.OUTPUT}
      OUTPUT: ${job.data}/final/grayscale.png
```

That's it! This job can now be executed with:

```shell
$ python -m xetl example/job.yml
```

```
